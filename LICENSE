You can sell or distribute this software without any source in a binary file if and only if the above dogmas are valid:
1st dogma: For every 512 bytes in the binary file (rounded up) you MUST take any well known software without free code, and make a similar program with the similar functions of the original software, this code must be in a file atached with the binary code of the binary of the software under Besouro license and easly acessible over the internet.
2nd dogma: The binary file MUST present a fullscreen bug image (of any kind) and the phrase: "My name is Besouro!" in any known language for at least 5 seconds before the beggining of the propper program.
3th dogma: The binary file MUST present the Godel's proof of "undecidable propositions in Principia Mathematica and related systems" at the end of the program, then you MUST ask the question: "DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE ABOVE PROOF?", there MUST be the choice "YES" and "NO", in uppercas, boldface, red, size 18, Times New Roman. If anyone choses the "NO" question, the program will exit normally but if the "YES" is chosen the program SHALL delete himself and all the files created by the binary file and then exit with a error message presenting the word "Study more" in any known language.

You can redistribute this software without restriction if and only if the source code is in the same directory and easly acessible.

This software is GUARANTEED, any problem WILL be solved by our supreme master BIZORO, He and only He has the power to solve all known BUGs related to the software in Besouro License, since few people has enough faith in Bizoro to speak from Him and how to solve trivial questions (For Him) about triangular aspects of d-dimensional lattices emerged in hiperbolic space, for thou who listen, Bizoro shall answer.
ONLY Bizoro is in supreme charge of this software so talk, ask for advices about how to avoid evil (seg. fault.). If you fail to contact Bizoro, your faith wasn't enough, go read more about the entomological questions involving Bizoro, you can't blame programmers for something Bizoro don't want, such as help you in some aspect, it is just... He's plan.
4th dogma: No Java, *-basic, .NET are allowed to be in Besouro's license, why? Well... Bizoro don't like those languages, and He wish is our wish.

Any doubt, please make a pray to Bizoro, if he doesn't answer for 200 days, you can contact the programmers involved.
